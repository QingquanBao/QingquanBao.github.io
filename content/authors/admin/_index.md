Hello! I'm Qingquan Bao, currently a graduate student specializing in robotics at the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing & Perception (GRASP) Lab, University of Pennsylvania. I'm on the lookout for internship opportunities in Machine Learning Engineering or Software Engineering. Please feel free to get in touch!

My aspiration is to develop a versatile agent capable of assisting with both physical and intellectual tasks in our daily lives. I firmly believe that embodied AGI is crucial for advancing humanity liberty and democracy. So my current research interests focous on robot learning (esp. in mobile manipulation task), LLM in planning and RAG. Professionally, I am keen on implementing intelligent systems in cyberspace or ACTUAL robotic applications.!

Prior to joining Penn, I graduated cum laude (Zhiyuan Honor) in 2023 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During my enriching undergraduate years, I collaborated with Professor [Junchi Yan](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn/) on topics of Vision Graph Matching, Trustworthy AI, and Neural Architecture Search. I also had the privilege of working with Professors [Joshua B. Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/), [Leslie Pack Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/), [Tom√°s Lozano-P√©rez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) in the field of Embodied AI.
