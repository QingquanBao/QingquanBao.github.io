Hi, I am Qingquan Bao, currently a graduate in robotics at GRASP lab at University of Pennsylvania. My dream is to build a general-purpose agent which serve as our daily assitant both in physical and intelletual works. My research interests include robot learning, LLM in planning and RAG.

I completed my undergrad cum laude in 2023 at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During those wonderful years, I worked with Professor Junchi Yan on topics of Vision Graph Matching and Adversarial Attack. I was also fortunate to work with Professors [Joshua B. Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/), [Leslie Pack Kaelbling](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/), [Tomás Lozano-Pérez](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/) on Embodied AI.
